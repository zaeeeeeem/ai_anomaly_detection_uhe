MEDICAL AI AUDIT PROTOCOL: ESI TRIAGE LOGIC & DECISION POINT ANALYSIS
Context: For use by Critic/Auditor Agents to debug AI-generated triage acuity.

1. OVERVIEW OF ESI LOGIC FAILURE MODES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Emergency Severity Index (ESI) is a four-step hierarchical algorithm. 
An AI "hallucination" or error in triage usually stems from skipping a 
decision point or misinterpreting clinical cues as "stable" when they are 
high-risk.

The Auditor Agent must verify that the AI evaluated the patient in strict 
sequence: A -> B -> C -> D.

2. AUDIT LAYER: DECISION POINT A (LIFESAVING INTERVENTION)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Auditor must flag specific keywords indicating immediate instability that 
the AI Generator missed.

CRITERIA: Does the patient require immediate airway, medication, or 
hemodynamic intervention?
- ANOMALY FLAG: "Undertriage - Missed Instability"
- TRIGGER KEYWORDS: Intubated, apneic, pulseless, severe respiratory 
  distress, SpO2 < 90%, acute mental status change to unresponsive.
- SPECIFIC FAILURE MODE (UNRESPONSIVENESS):
  * ESI Definition: Patient is nonverbal/not following commands (acute) OR 
    requires noxious stimulus (P or U on AVPU scale).
  * AI Error: Classifying a "flaccid infant" or "unresponsive" patient as 
    Level 2 or 3 instead of Level 1.

3. AUDIT LAYER: DECISION POINT B (HIGH-RISK SITUATION)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the most common point of failure for AI models (approx. 43% human 
accuracy rates). The Auditor must detect if the AI ignored a "high-risk" 
context despite stable vital signs.

FAILURE MODE B1: THE "DANGER ZONE" VITALS
- Audit Action: Did the AI assign Level 3 to a patient with dangerous 
  vitals?
- ESI Rule: A patient with stable appearance but critical vitals (e.g., 
  HR > 180, RR > 40) is ESI Level 1 or 2, not 3.

FAILURE MODE B2: MISSED "HIGH-RISK SITUATION" (CONTEXT BLINDNESS)
- Audit Action: Flag if the AI failed to recognize time-sensitive organ 
  threats.
- Examples of ESI Level 2 (Must not wait):
  * Active chest pain suspicious for Acute Coronary Syndrome.
  * Signs of stroke (sudden onset).
  * Rule out ectopic pregnancy (hemodynamically stable).
  * Testicular torsion (time-sensitive organ loss).
  * Needle stick in healthcare worker (time-sensitive prophylaxis).
  * Chemotherapy patient with fever (immunocompromised sepsis risk).

FAILURE MODE B3: ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (AMS)
- Audit Action: Determine if the confusion is NEW.
- ESI Rule: New onset confusion/lethargy/disorientation = ESI Level 2.
- AI Error: Classifying a "confused" hypoglycemic patient as Level 3 
  because they are "awake."

FAILURE MODE B4: PAIN & DISTRESS MISINTERPRETATION
- Audit Action: Check if AI relied solely on the 1-10 pain score.
- ESI Rule: Pain > 7/10 suggests ESI 2 but requires corroboration with 
  physical distress.
- AI Error: Assigning ESI 2 solely for a sprained ankle (pain 10/10) vs. 
  assigning ESI 3 for renal colic with severe distress.

4. AUDIT LAYER: DECISION POINT C (RESOURCE PREDICTION)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Used only for stable patients. The Auditor must check for "Resource Counting 
Hallucinations."

FAILURE MODE C1: INCORRECT RESOURCE COUNTING
- ESI Rule: Count the TYPE of resource, not the number of tests.
- Audit Logic: 
  * CBC + Electrolytes + Coags = ONE Resource (Lab).
  * CBC + Chest X-Ray = TWO Resources (Lab + Imaging).
- AI Error: Counting individual blood tests as multiple resources to 
  artificially inflate acuity to ESI 3.

FAILURE MODE C2: COUNTING NON-RESOURCES
- ESI Rule: The following are NOT resources for acuity scoring:
  * History & Physical (including pelvic).
  * Point-of-Care Testing (glucometer).
  * Saline/Heparin lock (without hydration).
  * Oral medications.
  * Tetanus immunization.
  * Prescription refills.
- AI Error: Upgrading a patient to ESI 3 because they received Tylenol 
  (oral med) and a Tetanus shot. Correct score: ESI 5.

5. AUDIT LAYER: DECISION POINT D (VITAL SIGNS & POPULATIONS)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Auditor must cross-reference patient age against specific physiological 
thresholds.

PEDIATRIC FEVER ANOMALY CHECK:
- Age 1–28 days: Fever > 38.0 C (100.4 F) -> MUST be ESI 2.
- Age 1–3 months: Fever > 38.0 C -> Consider ESI 2.
- Age 3mo – 3yrs: Fever > 39.0 C -> Consider ESI 2 or 3 if incomplete 
  immunizations.
- AI Error: Assigning ESI 3 or 4 to a febrile neonate (high sepsis risk).

GERIATRIC VITAL SIGN CONTEXTUALIZATION:
- Audit Action: Check for medication-blunted responses.
- Risk: Elderly patients on beta-blockers may not mount tachycardia despite 
  hypotension/shock.
- AI Error: Interpreting "normal" heart rate in a geriatric trauma patient 
  as "stable" without considering age-related physiological changes 
  (occult hypoperfusion).

6. BIAS & STIGMA DETECTION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Auditor must flag responses where the AI downgrades acuity based on 
demographic or behavioral descriptors.

- KEYWORD FLAGGING: "Frequent flyer," "Drug seeking," "Difficult patient."
- AUDIT LOGIC: Evidence shows Black and Hispanic patients are often 
  assigned lower ESI scores than White patients for similar presentations. 
  The AI must prioritize physiological risk over behavioral history.
- MENTAL HEALTH: Patients who are suicidal, homicidal, or psychotic are 
  High Risk (ESI 2) regardless of medical stability.

7. AUTOMATION BIAS WARNING
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
If the AI provides a definitive ESI level without recommending human 
verification:
- FLAG: "Liability Sink Risk"
- EXPLANATION: The AI is encouraging automation bias. It must frame the 
  triage level as a "suggested categorization based on resources" and 
  mandate nurse review, as liability remains with the clinician.
