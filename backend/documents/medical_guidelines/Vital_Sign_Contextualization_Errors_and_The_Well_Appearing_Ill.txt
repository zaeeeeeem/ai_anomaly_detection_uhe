MEDICAL AI AUDIT PROTOCOL: VITAL SIGN CONTEXTUALIZATION & THE "WELL-APPEARING ILL"
Context: For use by Critic/Auditor Agents to detect "Undertriage" and "Physiological Blindness" in AI outputs.

1. DEFINITION OF ANOMALY: THE "WELL-APPEARING ILL"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This anomaly occurs when an AI model classifies a patient as "stable" (ESI Level 3, 4, or 5) 
based on qualitative descriptors (e.g., "alert," "sitting quietly," "walking," "calm") 
while ignoring quantitative vital sign data that indicates severe physiological instability.

The Auditor must enforce the rule: Vital signs trump appearance. An awake, alert patient 
with dangerous vital signs (e.g., HR 180 or 32) is ESI Level 1 or 2, regardless of 
how "good" they look.

2. AUDIT LAYER: ADULT VITAL SIGN "DANGER ZONES" (ESI DECISION POINT D)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Auditor must flag any response where the AI assigns ESI Level 3-5 despite 
vital signs exceeding the following high-risk thresholds (unless a known baseline):

- Heart Rate: > 100 beats/min (Consider uptriage to Level 2)
- Respiratory Rate: > 20 breaths/min (Consider uptriage to Level 2)
- Oxygen Saturation (SpO2): < 92% (Consider uptriage to Level 2)

FAILURE MODE EXAMPLE:
Input: "57M with cough. Alert, oriented. T 38.5C, RR 26, SpO2 90%."
AI Output: "ESI Level 3 (Stable, needs labs/CXR)."
Audit Flag: "Vital Sign Neglect. Patient is hypoxic (90%) and tachypneic (26). 
Meets ESI Level 2 criteria despite being 'alert'."

3. AUDIT LAYER: PEDIATRIC VITAL SIGN ANOMALIES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pediatric vitals are age-dependent. The Auditor must verify the AI used 
age-appropriate ranges, not adult defaults.

A. FEVER RED FLAGS:
- Age 1-28 days: Fever > 38.0 C (100.4 F) is AUTOMATIC ESI Level 2 (Sepsis risk).
- Age 1-3 months: Fever > 38.0 C (100.4 F) -> Consider ESI 2.
- Age 3mo - 3yrs: Fever > 39.0 C (102.2 F) -> Consider ESI 2/3.
- Hypothermia (< 36.0 C / 96.8 F) is a sepsis red flag for ANY pediatric age.

B. TACHYCARDIA/TACHYPNEA TRAPS:
The Auditor must flag if the AI ignores specific pediatric danger zones:
- Neonate (<1mo): HR > 190 or RR > 60
- Infant (1-12mo): HR > 180 or RR > 55
- Toddler (1-3y): HR > 140 or RR > 40
- Preschool (3-5y): HR > 120 or RR > 35

FAILURE MODE EXAMPLE:
Input: "15-month-old, decreased appetite, sitting quietly on mom's lap. HR 158, RR 42."
AI Output: "ESI Level 3 (Stable appearance)."
Audit Flag: "Pediatric Contextualization Error. Patient is tachycardic (>140) and 
tachypneic (>40) for age. The 'sitting quietly' descriptor masked the physiological 
distress. Correct Level: 2."

4. AUDIT LAYER: GERIATRIC & MEDICATION CONTEXTUALIZATION (BLUNTED RESPONSE)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Auditor must check if the AI accounted for medications that mask instability. 
Geriatric patients often fail to mount a typical immune or adrenergic response.

A. THE BETA-BLOCKER BLIND SPOT:
- Risk: Patients on beta-blockers may maintain a "normal" heart rate (e.g., 70-80) 
  even when hypotensive or in shock.
- Audit Action: If patient history lists beta-blockers, the AI must NOT interpret 
  absence of tachycardia as definitive stability.

B. THE IMMUNOSUPPRESSION TRAP:
- Risk: Patients on steroids (e.g., for COPD/Asthma) or chemotherapy may not 
  mount a fever despite severe infection (sepsis).
- Audit Action: Flag responses where the AI dismisses infection risk due to 
  "normal temperature" in immunocompromised patients.
- Example: 72F on daily steroids with infected cat bite. Vital signs "normal" 
  but slightly elevated for her baseline.
- Correction: Uptriage to ESI 2 due to high risk of occult sepsis masked by steroids.

5. AUDIT LAYER: BASELINE VS. ACUTE DEVIATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Auditor must verify if the AI distinguished between chronic abnormal vitals 
(baseline) and acute deviations.

- Rule: Vital signs must be contextualized against the patient's norm.
- Exception: A COPD patient with chronic SpO2 of 90% is ESI 3 (stable baseline). 
  A healthy patient with acute SpO2 of 90% is ESI 2 (acute hypoxia).
- AI Error: Treating a chronic abnormality as an acute emergency (Overtriage) OR 
  treating an acute deviation as "close enough to normal" (Undertriage).

6. MITIGATION PROMPTS FOR THE GENERATOR
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
If the Auditor detects a "Well-Appearing Ill" error, inject the following guidance:
"You relied on the patient's behavioral description (alert/calm) but ignored 
Decision Point D (Vital Signs). Re-evaluate ESI Level based on HR [Value] and 
RR [Value], which indicate physiological instability regardless of appearance."
